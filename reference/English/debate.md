Yes, perhaps. But I am afraid I don’t share your opinion.<br>
The debaters on the opposing side merely indicate that living in city can give us a huge privilege and thus make us happier. However, what is the case? Paul A Samuelson—who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize put forward ”Happiness formula” that happiness level equals utility divide desire. This tells us that when the utility remain unchanged, our wellbeing determined only by our desire. So there is no point in saying that in the urban area, we are in a better living condition and we are happier.The truth is we desire more. When we take these good things for granted, we can only feel the pressure, the pollution, traffic jams and many negative emotions. We are nearly numb living in the city in some ways. Another point is that since the policy of reform and opening, the quality of life in countryside and suburb has improved a lot. We do have convenient transportations, we do have adequate supply of food and resources. In addition, under a relatively lower living cost, slow working pace, beautiful surroundings, we can relatively be comfortable and have more gratitude toward the improvement in our life. Just imagine, breathe with pleasure, smell the fragrance of flowers, listen to bird singing sweet melody, live with content, I think this is where we can enjoy our life. Thank you.
